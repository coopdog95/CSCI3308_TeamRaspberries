# Creating a RESTful API with Node.js
This repository accompanies my YouTube video series on building a RESTful API with Node.js: [https://github.com/academind/node-restful-api-tutorial.git](https://github.com/academind/node-restful-api-tutorial.git)

## Usage
Check out the branch you're interested in (i.e. which belongs to the video in my series you just watched), ```git clone``` it and thereafter run ```npm install```.
