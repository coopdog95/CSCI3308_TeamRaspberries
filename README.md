CSCI 3308 - Software Development Methods and Tools
Spring 2018 Semester Project

Description: Created a website to help farmers (and anyone in the agriculture industry) monitor their plants. An Arduino temperature/humidity sensor relays data back to a database, which we neatly display for the user via two types of graphs. With the ability to view their plants' locations via a python mapping library known as MapboxGL, we offer the user a new style of keeping an eye on their plants' temperature and humidity levels that helps bring agriculture into the 21st century.
